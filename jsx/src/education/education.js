        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This upcoming May, I will be graduating with my 
            Bachelors of Science in Physics, with a minor in Astrophysics, and a GPA of 
            3.23.
        </p> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physics taught me how to approach any problem in a logical way. Furthermore, 
            it teaches advanced mathematical and logical reasoning, organization skills,
            and allowed me to dip my feet into the vast world of computer programming.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been exposed to various fields in my time as a physics major,
            including various advanced math and statistical concepts, physics concepts from Astrophysics
            to quantum mechanics and solid state physics. 
        </p>
