        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research focuses on a set of Population III stars, 
            who are considered extremely metal-poor, where all elements besides hydrogen and helium
            are considered metals. These stars are considered to be some
            of the oldest stars in the universe. I observe and analyze the spectra of these stars,
            looking specifically at the abundances of rapid neutron capture elements (i.e. iron and lower on the
            periodic table).
        </p> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't worry if you don't know what some of those words mean. I'll explain below.</p>
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <h2>Electrons and Their Orbitals</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every atom in the universe is made up of three subatomic particles: neutrons, protons, and electrons. 
            Neutrons and protons make up the center of the atom, called the nucleus. The electrons orbit the nucleus in what are called orbitals. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some form of energy is given to the atom, an electron becomes excited and jumps to an orbital further away from the nucleus.
                However, like everything else in the universe, electrons want to be in the orbital that they originated at, and this state is called 
                the ground state. But what happens to the energy it gained? Well, the electron emits that energy in the form of a photon of light.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the element, the photon of light is
                emitted at a certain wavelength. From the photon at a certain wavelength that reaches 
                a telescope, we're able to find how much of that element is in the star. And that's exactly what I do.</p>
